Plan: Code Coverage
description: Ensure the highest level of code coverage possible

Review the existing code coverage + create an issues list of areas lacking coverage or that could use improved testing.

1. review existing coverage

2. define each issue in ./issues.md

3. repeat until all issues defined.
